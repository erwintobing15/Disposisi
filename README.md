# Disposisi

> An android application for managing letters and a REST API to integrate the app with MySQL database on the website server. This project is created for my volunteer work in BNNK Bandung, as per their request to create a mobile version of an existing web, so they can upload a letter without using computer. The source code for the rest api can be found [here](https://github.com/erwintobing15/restapi).
