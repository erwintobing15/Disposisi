# Disposisi

> Disposisi is an android application for managing letters. This is a project I created for my volunteer work in BNNK Bandung. I created this application as per their request to create a mobile version of an existing web that in developed then. So I created the web service too, to integrate with MySQL database. The application is created using java and android studio.
